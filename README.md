This project involved the successful design and implementation of a robust, web-based authentication system. It represents a significant step beyond traditional password vulnerabilities by leveraging asymmetric cryptography to establish a fundamentally more secure login process. Users authenticate by securely generating and registering their public keys, then validating their identity through cryptographically signed challenges, ensuring a truly passwordless and tamper-resistant user experience.

Key Capabilities:

Cryptographically Secure Enrollment: Implemented secure mechanisms for user registration and the robust storage of public keys.
Digital Signature-Based Authentication: Engineered a seamless, passwordless login flow by verifying unique digital signatures (utilizing RSA) in response to dynamic server-issued challenges.
Comprehensive Key Lifecycle Management: Developed functionalities for secure key updates and established robust revocation protocols.
Hardened Communication Channels: Ensured data confidentiality and integrity through mandatory TLS (HTTPS) across all interactions.
Transparent Security Auditing: Integrated detailed audit logging for all authentication attempts, critical for monitoring and compliance.
Flexible API Integration: Exposed a well-defined RESTful API with standardized JSON payloads, enabling straightforward integration with diverse applications.
Adherence to Security Standards: Designed and built in strict accordance with OWASP and NIST security guidelines, emphasizing resilience against common vulnerabilities.
Core Technologies:

Backend: Python with Django (chosen for its security features and rapid API development capabilities)
Key Handling: WebCrypto API (client-side) / OpenSSL (server-side, for low-level cryptographic operations)
Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL (selected for scalable and reliable data persistence)
Secure Transport: TLS 1.2+ HTTPS (ensuring secure communication channels)
